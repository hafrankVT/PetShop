		<h1>Welcome to the 1901 Group Pet Shop!</h1>
		<H3>Currently under construction</H3>

		<p>With practice comes confidence. I really believe that if you
			practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch
			brush. This piece of canvas is your world. I'm gonna start with a
			little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue I really
			recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you
			right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself.</p>

		<p>The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his
			job. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play
			back-and-forth. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in
			there. This painting comes right out of your heart. You can do
			anything your heart can imagine. This is truly an almighty mountain.</p>

		<p>It's cold, but it's beautiful. Almost everything is going to
			happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time
			working or worrying. And just raise cain. Now it's beginning to make
			a little sense.</p>

		<p>Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. I like to
			beat the brush. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing
			here. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to
			move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only
			thing I have power over is the garbage. Look around, look at what we
			have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. Be
			careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away.</p>

		<p>There we go. The light is your friend. Preserve it. It looks so
			good, I might as well not stop. Nothing's gonna make your husband or
			wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. Life
			is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. We
			don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care.</p>

		<p>It's important to me that you're happy. Even the worst thing we
			can do here is good. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any
			effort. Having a good day. Son of a gun.</p>

		<p>Let's do that again. This is your creation - and it's just as
			unique and special as you are. You can create anything that makes you
			happy. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and
			animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Brown
			is such a nice color. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is.</p>

		<p>We don't want to set these clouds on fire. This is your world.
			I'm going to mix up a little color. We'll use Van Dyke Brown,
			Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue.</p>

		<p>Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Maybe
			there's a happy little bush that lives right there. In life you need
			colors.</p>

		<p>If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. In
			your world you have total and absolute power. You're meant to have
			fun in life.</p>

		<p>Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will
			happen. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. You
			don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. What the devil.
			Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they
			sort of just make themselves. In this world, everything can be happy.</p>

		<p>If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right
			out of your painting and get your floor wet. We can fix anything. Put
			light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you
			have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the
			other one meaning. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. I was
			blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when
			you're doing these little delicate things. Don't hurry. Take your
			time and enjoy.</p>

		<p>The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason
			to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. You gotta
			think like a tree. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Have fun
			with it.</p>

		<p>Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. They
			say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes
			I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics. Let's get crazy. How to
			paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder.</p>

		<p>Let your imagination be your guide. Be brave. These little son
			of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out.
			There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. The only
			prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then
			it's good. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things.</p>

		<p>All you have to learn here is how to have fun. There is immense
			joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature.
			Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day
			long. A beautiful little sunset. With something so strong, a little
			bit can go a long way.</p>

		<p>The least little bit can do so much. You've got to learn to
			fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. We
			have all at one time or another mixed some mud.</p>

		<p>We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it
			fall where it will. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens
			you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. Isn't
			that fantastic? Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. If you
			overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a
			cloud killer.</p>

		<p>Just beat the devil out of it. Learn when to stop. We must be
			quiet, soft and gentle. You want your tree to have some character.
			Make it special. Here we're limited by the time we have. Now, we're
			going to fluff this cloud.</p>

		<p>I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown
			and a little touch of yellow. You can get away with a lot. That's
			what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you
			paint. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. If it's
			not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and
			expect it will get better. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun.</p>

		<p>Let's get wild today. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so
			we'll give him a little friend. You create the dream - then you bring
			it into your world. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. But we're
			not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. I'll go over the
			colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green,
			Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad
			yellow, and Permanent red.</p>

		<p>Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. Working
			it up and down, back and forth. Every day I learn. You can create the
			world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. Now
			let's put some happy little clouds in here. Making all those little
			fluffies that live in the clouds.</p>

		<p>That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no
			fear. Imagination is the key to painting. Work on one thing at a
			time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time.</p>

		<p>If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path.
			You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. Fluff it
			up a little and hypnotize it. If there's two big trees invariably
			sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. The first step to
			doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your
			mind before you ever start.</p>

		<p>Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be
			individuals. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy.
			When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose.</p>

		<p>Let your imagination be your guide. Exercising the imagination,
			experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are
			truly the windows to your soul. All you need to paint is a few tools,
			a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Let's go up in here,
			and start having some fun</p>

		<p>That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I
			want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. How do you
			make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for
			the day. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not
			wasted. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. Steve
			wants reflections, so let's give him reflections.</p>

		<p>Let's have a nice tree right here. Let's do it again then, what
			the heck. This is unplanned it really just happens. Don't fight it,
			use what happens. Just make a decision and let it go.</p>

		<p>Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in
			it. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you
			practice you can do. Let's have a little bit of fun today.</p>

		<p>It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet.
			Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. Of course
			he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. Let's
			have a happy little tree in here. We'll throw some old gray clouds in
			here just sneaking around and having fun.</p>
